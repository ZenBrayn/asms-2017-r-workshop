# Statistics and Bioinformatics using R

*ASMS 2017 Annual Conference Workshop*

## Workshop Information

* Indiana Convention Center
* Tuesday June 6, 2017
* 5:45 – 7:00 PM
* Room 133 – 134

## Abstract

The objectives of this workshop will be to introduce the community to the R statistical programming language, specifically the integrated development environment RStudio and a few select package libraries that facilitate data manipulation and plotting, along with presenting a few mass spectrometry relevant examples. We are proposing to structure the workshop around short 5-10 minute micro presentations introducing each subject followed by several minutes of open discussion. The overall goal of this workshop is to gauge the interests of ASMS attendees towards R statistical programming and to get a better understanding of
how R can best serve the community.
