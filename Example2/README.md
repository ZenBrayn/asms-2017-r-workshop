# Example #1: Data Cleaning, Tidying and Visualization

In this example, an example mzML file is read into R and the resulting data is reviewed with simple analysis and visualizations

The input data is taken from the [OpenMS Project](https://www.openms.de), and is not provided here.  The data can be downloaded as part of the example data provided in the [OpenMS Tutorial Example Data](https://www.openms.de/tutorials/):

1. First download the Example Data
2. Unzip the resulting archive
3. The example data reviewed under:
    Example_Data/Labelfree/datasets/lfq_spikein_dilution_1.mzML
4. Move or copy this file to the ```input_data``` directory inside this repository

## Scripts
1. ```01_explore_ms_data.Rmd```: this .Rmd document covers the reading and data exploration of the example data file noted above.
